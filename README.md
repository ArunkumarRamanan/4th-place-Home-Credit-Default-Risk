# 4th-place-Home-Credit-Default-Risk

Sample codes and dashboards for 4th place solution for Kaggle's Home Credit Default Risk competition
These are some dashboardas and codes we used through this competition, our approach has been mainly based on the follwinf approach:

* everyone creates his own features and oofs to the end of the competition,
* pooling our features and creating more oofs,
* training different 1-layer stacking models, 
* tuning models and blending


As most of ML enthusiasts know feature engineering is the most important part of every ML competition and most informal one, everyone does it his/her way so instead of talking about feature engineering, here we 
present some feature engineering based on many good public kernels and our own that are used to create diverse models.
